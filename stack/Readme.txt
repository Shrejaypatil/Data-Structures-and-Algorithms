stack flow:

1. implement with c++
2. implement with c
3. two stack ques
4. reverse a string/ number
5. paranthesis
6. insert at middle
7. insert at bottom of stack
8. sort a stack
9. redundunt brackets
10. make valid string

NOTE: whenever we need to modify the value inside stack use a count variable 
and bring that count up to that position and than do the action you want, make 
sure to use recursive call to ensure all the elements are safe. as recursion uses
runtime stack in the backend.
