🛠️ Code Examples
Here’s a sample of the code from the number systems module:

cpp
Copy code
// dec_to_bin.cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void decToBinary(int n) {
    int binary[32];
    int i = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        binary[i] = n % 2;
        n = n / 2;
        i++;
    }
    for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
        cout << binary[j];
}

int main() {
    int n = 10;
    decToBinary(n);
    return 0;
}
