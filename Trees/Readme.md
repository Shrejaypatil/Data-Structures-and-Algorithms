Points to Note:


1. Tree datastructure basically is a non linear data structure

2. it can be solved using pointers easily


Whenever we solve tree questions remmember:


1. we need to traverse both left and right part recursively using root->left and root->right as params to recursive call

2. when we solve questions where we need to leverage two data simultaneously like bool and int or int and int we need to use pair to reduce time complexity

3. ******* Most important base cond is always root == NULL *******

4. divide ans into parts and recursively call for each part than finally use if stmt to resolve all parts ans


Questions must do :

1. Height of btree
2. Diameter of tree
3. longest path of btree
4. identical trees
5. sum tree
6. balanced tree

These will cover most of the interview related concepts for intermediate interviews.
